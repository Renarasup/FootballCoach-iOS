More on Crashlytics: this service sends me crash reports detailing what happened in the code during the crash itself, which will help me diagnose issues quicker. The only pieces of device information contained in these reports are your iOS version and the iPhone/iPad/iPod touch model you are on. No personal data is sent to me. Don’t hesitate to email me if you have any concerns about this.
